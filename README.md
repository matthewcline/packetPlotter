# packetPlotter

packetPlotter maps the path of a packet across an IP network in real-time.  It displays markers to specify the geographic location of each hop along the path from the source to the destination.  In addition, it includes links from each hop to the next and displays the average latency of each link.

Example: Path of a packet from Berkeley, CA, USA to Zanzibar University in Tanzania http://www.zanvarsity.ac.tz/
